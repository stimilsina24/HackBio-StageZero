| **Introduction**                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| *[Cancer is a disease of uncontrolled proliferation by transformed    |
| cells subject to evolution by natural selection]{.mark}* (Brown et    |
| al., 2023) [It's not merely seen as an uncontrolled cell growth but   |
| as an evolving disease driven by transformed cells and they undergo   |
| natural selection within the tumor environment. Proliferation of      |
| these abnormal cells remain unchecked by genetic and epigenetic       |
| alterations. The traditional Bulk RNAseq uses a tissue or cell        |
| population as a starting material, and results in a mixture of        |
| different gene expression profiles from the studied material however, |
| The true signals driving the tumorigenesis or therapeutic resistance  |
| from a rare cell population or cell type can be obscured by an        |
| average gene expression profile from bulk RNASeq. This biological     |
| challenge catalyzed the birth of scRNAseq, an alternative RNAseq      |
| technology]{.mark} (Li & Wang, 2021)[. With single-cell RNA           |
| sequencing, it is now possible to analyse the transcriptome at        |
| single-cell level for over millions of cells in a single study. This  |
| allows us to classify, characterize and distinguish each cell at the  |
| transcriptome level, which leads to identify rare cell population but |
| functionally important]{.mark} (Jovic et al., 2022) [Tumor            |
| heterogeneity is a phenomenon that refers to the tumor-by-tumor       |
| differences among different patients and is dependent on              |
| environmental factors impacting patients' phenotypes and also the     |
| cellular diversity within the same tumor or between primary and       |
| metastatic lesions. It includes copy number variations, epigenetic    |
| alterations, coding and non-coding somatic alterations, and           |
| transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome differences]{.mark} (Proietto |
| et al., 2023)[. During tumor progression and development, clonal      |
| evolution and tumor heterogeneity lead to a series of biological and  |
| host environment changes, mainly through the alteration of            |
| transcriptome expression and crosstalk among cells]{.mark} (Zhang et  |
| al., 2022)[. With this, clonal heterogeneity and tumor evolution      |
| contribute to acquiring target drug resistance by variable and        |
| changed therapeutic targets, therefore leading to therapeutic         |
| resistance. With the knowledge of cancer evolving through cellular    |
| diversity, single cell data is transforming how they understand its   |
| progression, heterogeneity, and therapeutic resistance.]{.mark}       |
|                                                                       |
| **About single-cell technologies (sc-RNAseq)**                        |
|                                                                       |
| S[ingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique that  |
| measures gene expression at the resolution of individual cells,       |
| revealing cellular heterogeneity that bulk RNA-seq, which provides    |
| only average expression values across many cells, cannot detect.      |
| While scRNA-seq primarily profiles RNA, related single-cell methods   |
| have been adapted for other omics layers, including single-cell       |
| whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) to study DNA copy number variations   |
| and mutations (Lim et al, 2020). These approaches are particularly    |
| valuable in cancer biology, where they help uncover tumor             |
| heterogeneity, identify rare subpopulations such as cancer stem       |
| cells, and trace the functional development and evolution of tumors   |
| (Boxer et al, 2025, Tirosh et al, 2024). Experimental design in       |
| scRNA-seq depends on the biological question, whether exploring cell  |
| type diversity, treatment response, developmental trajectories, or    |
| tumor microenvironment composition, and can involve methods like      |
| droplet-based or plate-based sequencing for varying depth and         |
| throughput. Single-cell sequencing became necessary because older     |
| technologies, including bulk transcriptomics methods like microarrays |
| and RNA-seq, masked the variability between cells, making it          |
| impossible to distinguish distinct transcriptional states or detect   |
| minority cell types (Zhang et al, 2021). Non-single-cell              |
| transcriptomics technologies, while useful for identifying broad      |
| expression patterns, are limited by their inability to capture        |
| cellular context and dynamic changes within tissues. More broadly,    |
| transcriptomics as a field is limited because RNA levels do not       |
| always correlate directly with protein abundance or activity. By      |
| resolving these layers of complexity, scRNA-seq enables a functional  |
| understanding of tumor development, revealing how individual cells    |
| contribute to malignancy, resistance, and metastasis (Boxer et al,    |
| 2025).]{.mark}                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| **How scRNA-seq reveals tumor heterogeneity**                         |
|                                                                       |
| Tumors of the same kind can vary between different patients due to    |
| mutations in the cancer cells (National Cancer Institute, 2011).      |
| Additionally, there can be mutations within cancer cells of the same  |
| tumor when compared to other cells in it (National Cancer Institute,  |
| 2011). This phenomenon, known as tumor heterogeneity, contributes     |
| significantly to cancer diagnosis, treatment decisions, and how the   |
| tumor responds to therapy (National Cancer Institute, 2011).          |
|                                                                       |
| Tumor heterogeneity presents a significant obstacle to cancer         |
| treatment and diagnosis (Patel et al., 2014). Tumors can differ from  |
| each other in stage, genetic mutations, or gene activity (Patel et    |
| al., 2014). These differences lead to varying disease outcomes and    |
| make tumors respond differently to treatments (Patel et al., 2014).   |
|                                                                       |
| The combined effects of epigenetic and genetic changes, selective     |
| forces, and environmental cues are the key determinants of tumor      |
| heterogeneity (Bagnoli et al., 2019). This variability leads to       |
| unpredictable outcomes of cancer treatment in patients (Bagnoli et    |
| al., 2019). Thus, analysing heterogeneity in gene expression level    |
| among cells within a single tumor is an important component of this   |
| work (Bagnoli et al., 2019). Hence, single-cell RNA-sequencing        |
| (scRNA-seq) technologies are a crucial tool for cancer research       |
| (Bagnoli et al., 2019). There is another scRNA-seq method that is     |
| highly sensitive and powerful, plate-based, known as mcSCRB-seq       |
| (molecular crowding single-cell RNA barcoding and sequencing), which  |
| is capable of producing transcriptome data from cancer cells (Bagnoli |
| et al., 2019). The scRNA-seq has an easy-to-use workflow with low     |
| per-cell cost and requires no specialized equipment (Bagnoli et al.,  |
| 2019).                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| The bulk RNA-sequencing works with a combination of all cells, thus   |
| combining gene expression signals across cells, thereby hiding        |
| transcriptional profiles of specific cell types (Wu et al., 2021).    |
| However, single-cell RNA-sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) maps the gene        |
| expression of individual cells and uncovers the intercellular         |
| signaling interactions (Wu et al., 2021). Therefore, scRNA-seq        |
| enables a comprehensive understanding of the tumor ecosystem,         |
| revealing how intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity operate (Wu |
| et al., 2021). Single-cell RNA sequencing classified                  |
| tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs), comprising monocytes,        |
| macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes, were identified in at |
| least 25 distinct states (Wu et al., 2021).                           |
|                                                                       |
| According to the research (Wu et al., 2021), the authors analyzed 42  |
| tissue biopsy samples from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)         |
| patients by using scRNA-seq. The study (Wu et al., 2021) also         |
| identifies a correlation between tumor heterogeneity and              |
| tumor-associated neutrophils, which could help clarify their role in  |
| NSCLC. Using scRNA-seq, the authors (Wu et al., 2021) visualized cell |
| clusters through UMAP and inferred features like copy number          |
| variation and transcriptional states. This moves the analysis from    |
| simply recognizing heterogeneity to understanding the distinct        |
| cellular states and their interactions.                               |
|                                                                       |
| **scRNA-seq and therapy resistance in cancer**                        |
|                                                                       |
| The cancer therapy resistance reasons include gene mutations, efflux  |
| pumps, alterations in signaling pathways, and tumor heterogeneity.    |
| The principal strategy to overcome these tumor drug resistance causes |
| is personalized therapy, for which single-cell RNA sequencing plays   |
| the crucial role. Single-cell RNA sequencing, alone and integrated,   |
| can help to identify tumor expression profiles based on the single    |
| cancer cell expression patterns, which can consequently serve for     |
| precise treatment. (Garg et al., 2024) Transcriptional mapping across |
| the individual cancer cells\' issues from the scRNA-seq analysis      |
| allows us to identify the somatic mutations, which are crucial for    |
| tumorigenesis. Generally, somatic mutations are represented by gene   |
| mutation heterogeneity and genomic instability. Many studies of the   |
| cancer mutational landscape through various cancer types showed that  |
| the most mutated genes are oncogenes. However, scRNA-seq enables      |
| detailed cell typing of tumor tissue by analyzing the distinct cell   |
| mutational states of malignant cells. Additionally, it provides       |
| insights into how tumor cells interact with their microenvironment,   |
| as well as how genetic and epigenetic factors influence these cell    |
| states. This approach helps identify the diverse populations of cells |
| within a tumor, offering a comprehensive view of tumor heterogeneity  |
| and the molecular underpinnings of cancer progression. (Zhang et al., |
| 2021) Altogether, scRNA-seq provides valuable insights into genetic   |
| and phenotypic heterogeneity within tumors. By examining individual   |
| cells, scRNA-seq reveals how tumor cells differ in gene expression,   |
| even within the same tumor, which is crucial for understanding cancer |
| drug resistance. This technique helps identify drug-resistant cell    |
| populations, highlighting how specific mutations or altered gene      |
| expression can contribute to treatment failure. For instance, in      |
| liver cancer, scRNA-seq has shown how genetic mutations can drive     |
| phenotypic diversity by affecting gene expression, even for genes not |
| directly mutated. These findings underscore the importance of         |
| scRNA-seq in uncovering the molecular mechanisms that lead to therapy |
| resistance, providing a foundation for targeted therapeutic           |
| strategies in precision oncology. (Rosati et al., 2022)               |
|                                                                       |
| **scRNA-seq impact on clinical and therapeutic aspects of cancer**    |
|                                                                       |
| scRNA‑seq makes a significant contribution to unraveling cellular     |
| heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment states, which can improve    |
| diagnosis, prognostication, patient stratification, and therapeutic   |
| target discovery. It informs mechanisms of drug resistance and        |
| enables predictive signatures and trials‑integrated precision         |
| oncology, though it also faces technical, analytical, and validation  |
| barriers. (Conde‐López et al., 2024; Cosgrove et al., 2024; Deng et   |
| al., 2023; Hawsawi et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025;  |
| Suhl et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024; Yan et al., 2024; Zhao et al.,  |
| 2024)                                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| *Clinical applications*                                               |
|                                                                       |
| As for clinical application, scRNA-seq offers high-resolution         |
| insights into tumors and their surrounding microenvironment, allowing |
| for the identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic markers, as |
| well as more precise patient stratification. That becomes possible    |
| through identification of distinct cell type signatures, rare         |
| subpopulations, and immune/stromal profiles that correlate with       |
| patient outcomes and treatment responses. Therefore, scRNA-seq data   |
| analysis results in four main categories of clinically important      |
| output: diagnostics assistance, prognostic signatures, patient        |
| stratification, and advanced cancer prognosis when combined with      |
| spatial transcriptomics analysis. (Cosgrove et al., 2024; Deng et     |
| al., 2023; Li et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025; Suhl et al., 2025)     |
| Diagnosis insights are possible because scRNA-seq can uncover rare    |
| malignant and non-malignant cell populations and lineage programs     |
| that can refine tumor classification and suggest new biomarkers for   |
| early detection and differential diagnosis. (Deng et al., 2023) Gene  |
| signatures derived from single-cell analysis and integrated           |
| approaches combining single-cell and bulk data have led to the        |
| development of prognostic classifiers and predictors of disease-free  |
| survival. This includes signatures that can forecast the response to  |
| adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. (Song et al., 2025;       |
| Cosgrove et al., 2024) scRNA-seq identifies molecular and             |
| microenvironmental subtypes, such as fibroblast- or immune-based      |
| subtypes, which can be used to stratify patients based on their       |
| likely response to immunotherapy or targeted therapies. (Li et al.,   |
| 2025; Suhl et al., 2025) Integrating scRNA-seq with spatial           |
| transcriptomics enhances prognostic modeling by associating malignant |
| subtypes with their specific tissue locations and the surrounding     |
| immune microenvironment. (Cosgrove et al., 2024)                      |
|                                                                       |
| *Therapeutic implications*                                            |
|                                                                       |
| As for therapeutic application, scRNA‑seq reveals mechanistic drivers |
| of therapy failure and supports treatment selection and personalized  |
| interventions by identifying resistant clones, cellular states, and   |
| actionable targets. Clinical translation has begun via target         |
| discovery, biomarker validation, and incorporation into trial         |
| workflows. Thus, scRNA-seq provides drug resistance mechanism         |
| insights, cancer treatment response prediction, drug target           |
| identification and validation, and, as a result, precision oncology   |
| development. (Conde‐López et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2023; Hawsawi et |
| al., 2024; Song et al., 2025; Suhl et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024;   |
| Yan et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024) Nowadays, scRNA-seq affords to   |
| uncover drug resistance mechanisms by identifying stem-like states,   |
| rare resistant subclones, and immunosuppressive programs within the   |
| tumor microenvironment (TME) that contribute to both primary and      |
| acquired resistance to targeted therapies and immunotherapies. (Deng  |
| et al., 2023; Conde‐López et al., 2024; Hawsawi et al., 2024)         |
| Treatment response prediction is derived through cellular signatures  |
| and cell‑type composition identification. For example, scRNA-seq data |
| was used to predict chemotherapy and immunotherapy benefits in        |
| colorectal cancer and bladder cancer. (Song et al., 2025; Suhl et     |
| al., 2025) High‑throughput single‑cell profiling accompanied by       |
| multiomic cross‑validation assists in target discovery and            |
| validation. For example, in multiple myeloma, candidate surface and   |
| intracellular targets for immunotherapy have been yielded and can be  |
| further prioritized for preclinical and clinical testing. (Wang et    |
| al., 2024) Finally, embedding scRNA‑seq into clinical trial designs   |
| enables mapping of tumor evolution, on‑therapy state changes, and     |
| resistance trajectories. (Zhao et al., 2024; Yan et al., 2024)        |
|                                                                       |
| **Challenges and Future Directions**                                  |
|                                                                       |
| While scRNA-seq technology holds great potential for deciphering the  |
| mechanisms behind tumor heterogeneity and therapy resistance, some    |
| challenges still exist(Zhang et al., 2021). The main challenges stem  |
| from issues with reproducibility, elucidating true biological         |
| signals, and multi-omics analysis (Zhang et al., 2021; Feng et al.,   |
| 2024; Lei et al., 2021;Ding et al., 2020;Ibebkwe et al., 2024).       |
|                                                                       |
| Reproducibility is an important tenet of science and essential for    |
| any research finding to be deemed biologically or clinically          |
| relevant. Issues with reproducibility can arise for multiple reasons, |
| including biological variability or technical variability. Technical  |
| variability can stem from problems or differences in sample isolation |
| and preparation between each experiment or each research group.       |
| Similarly, variation in cell capture methods and sequencing protocols |
| by different kits (eg. 5' end or 3' end or full length transcript     |
| amplification) can lead to variations in RNA composition or           |
| annotation (Zhang et al., 2022; Fan et al., 2020). The use of         |
| standardized protocols for cell isolation, library preparation, and   |
| sequencing will reduce technical variability between samples and      |
| studies(Lei et al., 2021).                                            |
|                                                                       |
| Issues with reproducibility can also arise from differences in        |
| computational pipelines and algorithms used for data analysis, which  |
| can lead to different results from the same data(Zhang et al., 2021). |
| For example, using different statistical algorithms or different      |
| stringency or cutoff values for various steps in the analysis(Ding et |
| al., 2020; Feng et al., 2024). Cell annotation can also be a source   |
| of variability in data, as most annotations are manually performed    |
| and could potentially be subject to bias. Certain aspects of data     |
| analysis are inherently stochastic in nature, meaning that it can be  |
| subject to variability with each execution, further contributing to   |
| the issue of reproducibility. Good practices like consistently        |
| following standardized pipelines, transparency, and creating          |
| reproducible workflows will be helpful in reducing variability and    |
| enabling robust analysis(Feng et al., 2024; Ding et al., 2020). Other |
| sources of technical noise such as technical artifacts during         |
| sequencing such as dropouts or amplification bias need to be          |
| accounted for(Lei et al., 2021).                                      |
|                                                                       |
| Another major challenge in single cell sequencing analysis is         |
| accurately distinguishing real biological signals or heterogeneity    |
| from background noise(Zhang et al., 2021). Several technical and      |
| biological factors make it difficult to do this. For example, in      |
| contrast to bulk RNA-sequencing, the lower sequencing depth achieved  |
| in single cell RNA sequencing makes it more difficult to detect       |
| biologically relevant transcripts that are at lower abundance(Zhang   |
| et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2024;Ding et al., 2020). Mutations and     |
| copy number changes are a major source of heterogeneity in tumors due |
| to permanent alterations in the genetic and transcriptional landscape |
| of the cell(Zhang et al., 2021). Hence, tracking heterogeneity at the |
| single cell level through detection of mutations would be a fantastic |
| way to track changes in tumor subpopulations or treatment resistance. |
| Unfortunately, current algorithms don't allow for detection of        |
| mutational signatures, especially novel or low abundant ones(Fan et   |
| al., 2020; Rodriguez-Meira et al., 2019;Lei et al.,2021;). Overall,   |
| these limitations might result in missed identification of rare       |
| populations or subpopulations of cells or biological signals that are |
| relevant to heterogeneity or treatment resistance.                    |
|                                                                       |
| Proper cell type annotation is important for accurate identification  |
| of cellular heterogeneity or different cell populations in the        |
| sample. However, proper annotation goes hand in hand with             |
| contemporary biological knowledge, therefore, unknown or rare         |
| populations are difficult to accurately label( Feng et al., 2024;Ding |
| et al., 2020). Batch correction algorithms are used to reduce         |
| technical noise between samples or groups, referred as batch          |
| effects(Fan et al., 2020). Contemporary tools such as harmonization   |
| for batch correction can integrate samples smoothly but can lead to   |
| removal of biological signals, especially important intertumoral      |
| heterogeneity between patient samples(Liu et al., 2025). Using newer  |
| methods such as generalized binary covariance decomposition (GBCD)    |
| might be useful in overcoming loss of such relevant signals(Liu et    |
| al., 2025).                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| Continuous improvements in scRNA-seq technology and analysis          |
| algorithms will enhance reproducibility, accurate cell                |
| identification, while being able to extract even more meaningful data |
| than what is possible now. Despite the plethora of insights that can  |
| potentially be gained from scRNA-seq, it is not enough by itself to   |
| infer changes in biological function(Liu et al. 2016, Cell).          |
| Integration of scRNA-seq data with genomic, proteomic, and spatial    |
| data, especially at the single cell level, will be important to get a |
| better understanding of tumor biology(Feng et al., 2024;Ding et al.,  |
| 2020). Currently, single cell multi-omics analysis is rare and        |
| difficult, especially for single cells, due to lack of multi-omics    |
| data from the same samples, differences in protocols used for sample  |
| isolation, or lack of algorithms (Feng et al., 2024;Ding et al.,      |
| 2020). However, with the availability of concurrent multi-omic sample |
| availability and analysis in the future, it will become a more common |
| approach for the study of tumor heterogeneity and treatment           |
| resistance(Feng et al., 2024;Ding et al., 2020). Similarly, improved  |
| sequencing platforms and algorithms for detection of novel or         |
| changing mutation, and prediction of drug sensitivity in cell         |
| populations will further improve the impact of scRNA-seq. Finally, as |
| a result of all these improvements, personalized Medicine will become |
| more refined and closer to fruition(Ding et al., 2020; Feng et al.,   |
| 2024; Lei et al., 2021).                                              |
|                                                                       |
| **Conclusion**                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing has fundamentally         |
| transformed the standard of oncology, shifting our comprehension of   |
| cancer from a histopathological perspective to a dynamic,             |
| eco-evolutionary model. By unraveling the transcriptional diversity   |
| within tumors at a unit resolution, scRNA-seq has shed light on the   |
| core mechanisms of tumorigenesis, metastasis, and therapeutic         |
| resistance: the rare subpopulations of cells, adaptable cellular      |
| states, and intricate cellular interactions that were previously      |
| hidden by conventional bulk analytical techniques. This technology    |
| has become essential not only for cataloging the cellular components  |
| of the tumor microenvironment but also for functionally analyzing how |
| clonal evolution and cellular interactions collaboratively contribute |
| to treatment failure.                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| The translational implications of this new age of medicine are        |
| already becoming evident. In clinical practice, scRNA-seq is          |
| enhancing nosology by facilitating molecularly-driven, single-cell    |
| defined classifications of cancer. From a prognostic perspective, it  |
| provides signatures that predict disease progression and treatment    |
| response, advancing our efforts toward more accurate patient          |
| stratification. In terms of therapy, it acts as a robust discovery    |
| platform for new targets and offers a crucial perspective for         |
| comprehending the cellular and molecular foundations of both innate   |
| and acquired resistance, thus guiding the development of the next     |
| generation of combination therapies.                                  |
|                                                                       |
| Despite these significant advancements, the transition from           |
| technological potential to everyday clinical application is fraught   |
| with obstacles. Challenges related to technical reproducibility,      |
| analytical standardization, and the incorporation of multi-omic       |
| layers continue to pose considerable difficulties. Nevertheless, the  |
| real challenge lies in advancing from mere correlative transcriptomic |
| snapshots to a comprehensive, mechanistic, and systems-level          |
| comprehension of tumor biology. Future advancements will depend on    |
| the establishment of robust, standardized computational frameworks    |
| and the smooth integration of scRNA-seq with other complementary      |
| single-cell techniques such as genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and |
| spatial transcriptomics, thereby enabling the creation of cohesive    |
| multi-omic representations of malignancy.                             |
|                                                                       |
| This is to say scRNA-seq has offered the essential clarity to         |
| understand cancer as it fundamentally exists: a multifaceted,         |
| adaptive system. As we address existing challenges and incorporate    |
| these intricate molecular maps into clinical practices, we will not   |
| only anticipate and surmount resistance but also initiate a genuinely |
| personalized era of precision oncology, wherein treatments are        |
| dynamically customized to the changing environment of each patient\'s |
| illness, ultimately transforming the treatment landscape for future   |
| generations.                                                          |
